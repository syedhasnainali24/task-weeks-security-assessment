week4-findings:

1)Regarding week4 assignment/task, I had to make sure that monitoring is configured in my all this project and for which it is working fine , while just to update again that Fail2ban is being used for this purpose here
2)While for hardening the security through rate limiting and CSP, I have applied this in "server.ts" file of the owasp juice shop
3)I have achieved all this with the help of Git CLI interface and WSL Ubuntu too
