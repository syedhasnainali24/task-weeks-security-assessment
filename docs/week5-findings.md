Learnt through week5 assignment


1)Now to proceed with the assignment, I have installed Linux on windows platform and have used it through WSL
2)Installed SQLmap, nmap and other parameters/tools to analyze the web traffic and to find out vulnerabilities
3)Furthermore, Installed BurpSuite tool to analyze the web traffic contents used in owasp juice shop
4)analyze the services and their version running while running owasp juice shop through command; nmap -sV localhost -p 3000,8080
5)Used whatweb tool too to analyze whatelse is running behind the scenes for owasp juice shop
6)For SQL injection, tried "' OR 1=1 --" at logins field and login attempt has been successfully so website is sql injected and vulnerable
7) I am not the programmer or coder as I have explained earlier in previous assignments; so learnt about prepared statements in order to fix sql injection but have not implemented it as coding is required in this part but learnt the essence of prepared statements.
8)Learnt for CSRF and how to avoid this through csurf (but not from the coding perspective)
